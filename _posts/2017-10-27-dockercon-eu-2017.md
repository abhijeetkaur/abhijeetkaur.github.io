## **Introduction**

DockerCon EU 2017 was my first global conference ever (in fact, first time out of India). With the conference being held at Copenhagen, Denmark, it could not have been any better. Moreover, it was my first solo trip.
Around September, I came across Docker during my lunch break through a friend. I got interested in this idea and one evening, found myself reading  what Docker is all about. I stumbled on this conference page and got to know about it’s deadline.

I got thrilled about it and could see it as an incredible opportunity to widen my horizon both technically and professionally. Finding the registration fees to be too high for a recent university graduate, I applied for a scholarship. Luckily, I was one of the only 4 people who got selected from across the globe. I was the only one from India.

### _**And the journey begins...**_

I had a long flight to Copenhagen with a hop at Doha, Qatar (perhaps the largest airport I have ever been to <3 ). I was both nervous (my first solo trip to a foreign land and my first conference!) and excited (obviously!) as I was about to reach Copenhagen. There was a bus running continuously from the Airport to the Hotel, where there I had a beautiful room waiting for me.

### _**Day 0**_

The evening started with a pre-conference networking session and I was really looking forward to meeting new people and sharing each other’s stories and passion. The networking sessions were very playful and I believe the Docker team did a great job in making an introvert like me to smoothly blend in. After the networking session we had snacks and the ecosystem expo-booths were opened. The first booth was that of Microsoft, where I met employees from the headquarters.  
![img1](../../static/img/docker_whale.jpg) The expo-booth comprised of more than 25 companies like Redis, Data Dog, Red Hat, Oracle, IBM, Nginx and so on. Microsoft displayed the following three things: how we can use docker on windows, how we can use Docker and Kubernetes from Azure, and how we can monitor/analyse our running docker instances(containers)  on the Azure portal. A few other booths exhibited how we could make docker more secure, how to have permanent and higher storage with Docker and how to obtain insights on Docker instances. The next day was completely packed with some awesome sessions going on simultaneously. I wished I had Hermione’s time turner to attend each one of them. I, along with some new friends, decided a list of conferences we’ll be attending.

### _**Day 1**_

The day started with Keynote speeches. Docker Inc. shook up the entire container market with the announcement that Docker will embrace the rival open-source Kubernetes container orchestration system. Some of the main highlight sessions of the day were:
* __Rock stars, Builder and Janitors: You’re doing it wrong__<br/>
  In this spellbinding talk,highlighting the importance of DevOps, Alice Goldfuss compares the rock star, who is always rolling out a new demo or installing a new technology in your stack; the builder, who makes it reliable and makes it scale; the janitor, who cleans up all your messes, writes your docs, and tweaks your configs. She then brings out the importance of being a combination of all of these three in order to succeed as a team and an organization.

* __Stronger Security through containers and Machine learning__<br/>
  This was an insightful talk given by the CTO of Twistlock. Security is one of the top concerns while developing any application. Twistlock helps in protecting containers running on Microsoft Azure and Azure Container Service, integrating with Operations Management Suite, and protecting Windows Containers.

* __Repainting the past with distributed machine learning and docker__ <br/>
  This was a very interesting talk on how two students wanted to use machine learning to repaint old black and white past pictures. But, machine learning iscomputationally quite an expensive process and they had limited resources. This highlighted the problems they faced, the choices they made by comparing all the available technologies, and how docker came to their rescue.

The conference ended at 6pm and then we had the Docker after party. The venue was the old train Workshop. Imagine being a participant in your favorite 70’s and 80’s arcade games. Walk among laser beams destroying asteroids and enemy spaceships and to control life sized Tetris bricks. It was really fun connecting with people and sharing stories.

### _**Day 2**_

The next day, I went to see the sunrise at The Little mermaid, [Nyhavn](https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/nyhavn-harbour-gdk426287) and  [Amalienborg Palace](https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/amalienborg-palace-gdk492887), and in that moment I realised that the journey was indeed much more beautiful than the destination.

The day’s keynote announced another big piece of news: IBM’s announcement that it is joining Docker’s Modernize Traditional Applications (MTA) program. MTA helps organizations transform legacy applications into modern cloud-ready, container-delivered applications.
Docker, Avanade, and Microsoft have already partnered together to Modernize Traditional Apps for portability, security and efficiency without recoding or refactoring the application. This program integrates Docker Enterprise Edition, enterprise consulting expertise and cloud infrastructure to deliver demonstrable ROI within one week. The highlights from Day 2 sessions were:
* __Creating effective docker images__ <br/> 
  This talk had the entire room complete packed, with no space left for people to even stand. Abby Fuller brought to attention the need to write minimal images and how layers work. She also highlighted the best practices for windows container. She basically focused on how to optimise disk space utilization.
* __My journey to Go__<br/>
  Ashley McNamara, Principal Developer Advocate at Microsoft, narrated her awe-inspiring journey from being a photographer to a valuable contributor to the Go community. She resonated values of exploring, never giving up and grabbing opportunities.

Overall, the sessions were devoted to modernizing traditional applications, saving costs, customer success stories, improving security, using Docker on a variety of platforms, and deep diving into the development stack for a better understanding.

<p style="text-align: center;" > <i>Some awesome ladies at #DockerCon - We got to talk and connect so much. </i></p>

All sharing their stories and ideas with each other. The entire atmosphere became so high spirited. The sessions ended and I saw myself exploring the rest of city. It was truly magical!

### _**Day 3**_

Next day, we had hands-on moby summit in which we actually came to the coding part. This was highly technical and truly enlightening since we were basically running commands and executing scripts. After this ended, I had visited most of the places in Copenhagen. So now instead of ticking off places off my checklist, I decided to go on a walk by the river. Went on an unexpected ferry ride, which I say was truly a blessing to the soul.

### _**Bidding adieu..**_

It was a great experience to know the importance of ecosystem partners and how we need to collaborate to move ahead towards success. To have a meaningful impact we need to integrate with one another and have a bigger picture. I was highly touched by the significance of partner relationships.
Interacting with people from all walks of life, and how they got interested in docker and the diverse ways in which docker can be used everyday was truly awe-inspiring. 
Totally enthused by the conference and the technology, I have loads of new ideas to work on. Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. It provides a "Lego set" of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
I’ll maybe try to experiment and play with different combinations of the toolkit and improve performance in accordance with different application requirements.
A shout out to DockerCon’s organizing team for being super friendly and pampering me so much!
